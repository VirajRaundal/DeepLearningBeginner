# DeepLearningBeginner
Deep Learning projects I made while learning Deep Learning.

This repository includes the following projects:
1. Breast Cancer Classification using Neural Networks: By using Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Tensorflow and Keras (Python libraries), I implemented a system wherein the algorithm would predict if the cancer is benign or malignant by using various parameters such as mean radius, mean texture, mean perimeter etc.

  I had to use Keras and Tensorflow to setup, compile and train the Neural Network on the given dataset.
